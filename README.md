# Volleyball-team-size
The code which I have written is to get a estimation of how many people are willing to play volleyball.
I have used python programming language to built this code.
I have used loops to built this code and it is pretty easy understable code for my volleyball associates.
Overall this code really makes sense for my associates to take part of the game.
